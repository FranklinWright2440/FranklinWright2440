## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a backend developer building robust, maintainable web applications using Ruby on Rails. This project showcases how Rails can be used to deliver full-featured backends with a strong emphasis on RESTful API design, database management, and background job processing.

At the core of this application is a clean, well-structured RESTful API built using Rails' conventions. Resources are exposed with predictable, versioned endpoints that follow industry standards, making integration with frontend applications or third-party services straightforward. I use tools like Jbuilder or ActiveModel::Serializers to format JSON responses, and implement features like pagination, filtering, and authentication to support real-world use cases.

Behind the API is a solid data layer powered by Active Record and a relational database like PostgreSQL. I follow best practices for schema design, indexing, and data validations to ensure data integrity and performance. Complex business logic is encapsulated in models, services, and concerns, promoting a clean separation of responsibilities and testability.

For background processing, this project integrates tools like Sidekiq or Delayed Job to handle asynchronous tasks such as email delivery, API polling, or data processing. These jobs are queued, monitored, and retried automatically, keeping the application responsive while offloading time-consuming work to background workers.

This repository is a practical example of how Ruby on Rails can be used to build scalable, well-architected backends for modern web applications. Whether youâ€™re working with a frontend SPA, a mobile app, or other clients, this codebase provides a flexible foundation for building and extending production-ready APIs.
